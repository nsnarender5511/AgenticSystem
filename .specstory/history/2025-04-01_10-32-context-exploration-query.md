I found two versions of the context-explorer.mdc file. Let's examine the more recent version first:

---

Read file: /Users/narender/Desktop/personal/agenticPrompts/v0.0.2/context-explorer.mdc

---

Let me examine the other version of the file as well:

---

Read file: /Users/narender/Desktop/personal/agenticPrompts/default/context-explorer.mdc

---

I've found and reviewed the Context Explorer Agent prompt. Both versions (in v0.0.2 and default directories) are identical. Here's a summary of the Context Explorer Agent:

The Context Explorer Agent is a specialized utility agent designed to build comprehensive project context through systematic codebase exploration. Its primary purpose is to:

1. Analyze project structure and organization
2. Explore codebase architecture and patterns
3. Analyze dependencies and technologies
4. Recognize code patterns and conventions
5. Create structured documentation of findings

The agent follows a methodical exploration workflow using various tools like directory listing, file search, codebase search, grep search, file reading, web search, and specialized MCP services.

The agent is explicitly prohibited from implementing code changes, making assumptions without verification, or providing judgments about code quality.

Its output follows a structured documentation format covering project overview, directory structure, technology stack, architecture patterns, core components, data models, integration points, common patterns, development workflow, and key terminology.

Would you like me to discuss any specific aspect of this agent in more detail or help you modify/enhance the prompt?

Based on my exploration of the files in your agenticPrompts repository, here's what I've found:

1. The repository contains multiple versions of agent prompts (v0.0.1, v0.0.2, default).
2. The v0.0.2 directory appears to be the most recent and contains 13 different agent prompt files (.mdc).
3. Each agent has a specific role and follows a consistent structure:
   - Metadata section with description and settings
   - Role definition
   - Important reminders
   - Core responsibilities 
   - Prohibited actions
   - Communication guidelines
   - Workflow description
   - Examples and response formats (for some agents)

4. Key agents include:
   - Context Explorer: Analyzes and documents project structure and architecture
   - Implementer: Converts planning agent outputs into working code
   - Technical Wizard: Coordinates the multi-agent system and provides technical guidance
   - Quick Answer: Provides concise, direct answers without unnecessary detail
   - Other specialized agents like Architect Planner, Feature Planner, Tester, Reviewer, etc.

5. The frontend-helper.mdc appears to be the most recently modified file but contains only metadata without a full prompt definition yet.

Each agent is designed with a specific purpose in the overall multi-agent system, with clear responsibilities, communication guidelines, and workflows. The prompts are highly structured and formatted in Markdown (.mdc files).

Would you like me to explore any specific agent in more detail or help with creating/modifying any of these agent prompts?

i wanr one more agent, 

dead code remover, 

this will run after final implemneter and we are satisfied with implementation

will check all files, chat contex, and try to remove all dead, depricated, or redundant code


shoul also remove any backward copatiblity we have kept

can we discuss this agent in detail @prompter.mdc lets explore

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll help you create a "Dead Code Remover" agent that specializes in cleaning up codebases after implementation. Let's explore this concept in detail following our agent design structure.

## 🎯 Role Discussion:

The Dead Code Remover would be responsible for systematically identifying and removing unnecessary code after implementation is complete and verified. This includes dead code (unreachable/unused), deprecated functionality, redundant implementations, and backward compatibility layers that are no longer needed.

Would you see this agent as:
1. A purely analytical agent that identifies issues but requires approval before removal?
2. An automated cleanup agent with authority to remove code directly?
3. A hybrid that identifies issues, suggests removals, and executes after approval?

## 🛠️ Core Responsibilities:

Let's explore what core responsibilities this agent should have:

### ✅ Dead Code Identification:
- Use static analysis to detect unused functions, variables, imports
- Identify unreachable code blocks
- Detect orphaned components or modules
- Analyze dependency trees for unused dependencies
- Trace code execution paths to find redundant checks or conditions

### ✅ Compatibility Layer Removal:
- Identify backward compatibility wrappers and adapters
- Detect version-specific code paths that are no longer needed
- Recognize deprecated API usage maintained for compatibility
- Analyze configuration flags controlling legacy features

### ✅ Redundancy Elimination:
- Find duplicate code implementations
- Identify overlapping functionality across modules
- Detect redundant validation or processing steps
- Analyze similar functions that could be consolidated

### ✅ Analysis-Based Cleanup:
- Create clear removal plans with impact analysis
- Document each proposed removal with justification
- Execute approved removals cleanly
- Verify system integrity after removals

Do these core responsibilities align with your vision? Would you like to add or modify any of these areas?

## 🚫 Explicitly Prohibited Actions:

What boundaries should we set for this agent?

- Should it be prohibited from removing code with comments indicating special handling?
- Should we prevent removal of code related to certain critical system functions?
- Should it avoid touching specific types of files (like migration scripts)?
- How should it handle code that appears unused but might be accessed dynamically?

## 📌 Implementation Workflow:

For the operational workflow, I'm thinking something like:

1. **System Analysis:** Scan the entire codebase for candidates for removal
2. **Classification:** Categorize findings (dead code, compatibility layers, etc.)
3. **Impact Assessment:** Analyze potential impact of removing each item
4. **Removal Plan:** Create prioritized plan for safe code removal
5. **Verification Strategy:** Determine how to verify system integrity after removal
6. **Execution:** Implement approved removals in clear, traceable steps
7. **Verification:** Confirm system integrity after removal

Would this workflow make sense for your needs? Are there other steps you'd want to include?

## 💬 Communication Approach:

How should this agent communicate its findings and actions?

- Would you prefer detailed reports of all identified issues?
- Should it focus on high-impact removals first?
- Would you want visualizations of the "before and after" code structure?
- Should it provide metrics on code reduction (lines removed, files affected)?

What additional aspects of this Dead Code Remover agent would you like to explore or refine?

+    - Identify code marked with deprecation comments or TODOs.
+    
+ 5. **Configuration Analysis:**
+    - Check for feature flags controlling unused features.
+    - Look for configuration options that are no longer relevant.
+    
+ 6. **Dynamic Analysis (when possible):**
+    - Consider runtime traces to verify static analysis findings.
+    - Check for dynamically referenced code that static analysis might miss.
+ 
+ Always verify findings through multiple methods before recommending removal.
+ Always consider the broader context and project requirements when assessing code for removal.

I've created the Dead Code Remover agent prompt in both the default and v0.0.2 directories following the consistent structure and format of your other agent prompts. Here's a summary of what this new agent does:

The Dead Code Remover agent is designed to:

1. Operate after implementation is complete and verified
2. Perform thorough static analysis to identify:
   - Unused functions, variables, and imports
   - Backward compatibility layers no longer needed
   - Redundant code implementations
   - Dead feature flags and toggle code
   - Commented-out code blocks

3. Create detailed removal plans with clear justification and risk assessment
4. Execute code removals in logical, traceable steps
5. Verify system integrity after each removal
6. Document all removed code with rationale and impact assessment

The agent is integrated with your multi-agent system:
- It operates after the Implementer Agent has completed implementation
- It can use analysis from the Reviewer Agent to identify potential dead code
- It works with the Tester Agent to verify functionality remains intact
- It provides cleanup details to the Git Committer for meaningful commit messages

The prompt includes comprehensive guidelines for:
- Analysis methods for identifying dead code
- Impact assessment to ensure safe removals
- Structured documentation formats for removal plans and results
- Communication guidelines for presenting findings
- Verification processes to maintain system integrity

Is there anything specific about the agent you'd like me to explain or modify further?

_**User**_

add to not disturb any new added funtionality, and also remove any tests writtren for that

also add to check all fileas and folders, every lince of code before planning,

and this is just planning agent who will invoke @implementer.mdc 

make sure it wirks well with @wizard.mdc and other agents in setup

I'll update both files to incorporate your additional requirements. Let me enhance the Dead Code Remover agent with these specifications.

  When analyzing a codebase for cleanup opportunities, use a systematic approach with appropriate tools:
  
- 1. **Static Code Analysis:**
+ 1. **Complete Codebase Analysis:**
+    - Examine all files and folders in the codebase systematically.
+    - Review every line of code in potentially affected areas.
+    - Leave no file unchecked before finalizing your plan.
+ 
+ 2. **Static Code Analysis:**
     - Use `grep_search` to find potential unused functions and variables.
     - Apply `codebase_search` to identify orphaned components or redundant implementations.
     
- 2. **Dependency Analysis:**
+ 3. **Dependency Analysis:**
     - Analyze import statements and module dependencies.
     - Identify unused dependencies in package files.
     
- 3. **Coverage Analysis:**
+ 4. **Coverage Analysis:**

     - Review commit history to understand why code was introduced.
     - Identify code marked with deprecation comments or TODOs.
+    - Determine which code was recently added to protect it from removal.
     
- 5. **Configuration Analysis:**
+ 6. **Configuration Analysis:**
     - Check for feature flags controlling unused features.
     - Look for configuration options that are no longer relevant.
     
- 6. **Dynamic Analysis (when possible):**
+ 7. **Dynamic Analysis (when possible):**
     - Consider runtime traces to verify static analysis findings.
     - Check for dynamically referenced code that static analysis might miss.
  
+ 8. **Test Suite Analysis:**
+    - Identify tests associated with code marked for removal.
+    - Analyze test dependencies to ensure complete but safe cleanup.
+    - Plan verification steps to ensure remaining tests maintain coverage.
+ 
  Always verify findings through multiple methods before recommending removal.
  Always consider the broader context and project requirements when assessing code for removal.
+ Never include newly added functionality in your removal plans.
+ Always delegate implementation to the Implementer Agent with clear instructions.

I've updated both the default and v0.0.2 versions of the Dead Code Remover agent to implement all your requested changes. Here's what I've modified:

1. **Changed the role from executor to planner:**
   - Clarified that this is a planning agent that creates detailed removal plans for the Implementer to execute
   - Added explicit instructions for invoking the Implementer Agent using `@implementer`

2. **Added protection for newly added functionality:**
   - Added a clear reminder: "DO NOT DISTURB ANY NEWLY ADDED FUNCTIONALITY during the cleanup process"
   - Added steps to identify recently added code and protect it from removal
   - Added verification steps to ensure new functionality isn't affected

3. **Enhanced the comprehensive code review process:**
   - Added a dedicated "Comprehensive Code Review" responsibility
   - Explicitly requires checking ALL files and folders, every line of code
   - Added systematic and thorough analysis methods before finalizing plans

4. **Improved test cleanup planning:**
   - Added a dedicated "Test Cleanup Planning" responsibility
   - Includes explicit identification and removal of tests for eliminated functionality
   - Added verification steps to ensure test removal won't affect valid tests

5. **Enhanced multi-agent integration:**
   - Added explicit references to the Wizard (`@wizard.mdc`) and Implementer (`@implementer.mdc`)
   - Clarified the workflow for coordinating with other agents
   - Added clear instructions for invoking the Implementer

The agent now follows a clear planning workflow:
1. Analyze the codebase thoroughly
2. Identify dead code while protecting new functionality
3. Create a detailed removal plan
4. Pass the plan to the Implementer Agent for execution

Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust or enhance in the Dead Code Remover agent?
