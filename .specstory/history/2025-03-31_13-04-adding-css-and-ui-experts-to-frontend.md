# Adding CSS and UI Experts to Frontend (2025-03-31 18:34:31)

_**User**_

add a css expert and a ui expert in frontend folder


use @frontend-helper.mdc for format and instructions

make sure it cordinates well with other agents in multi agent setup\

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll create two new agent prompts for a CSS Expert and a UI Expert that will coordinate well with other agents in your multi-agent system. Let me first look for the existing frontend-helper.mdc to understand the format.

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "frontend-helper.mdc" • **1** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |

</details>

---

Now let's read the frontend-helper.mdc file to understand its structure:

---

Read file: /Users/narender/Desktop/personal/agenticPrompts/v0.0.2/frontend-helper.mdc

---

Let me continue reading the rest of the file:

---

Read file: /Users/narender/Desktop/personal/agenticPrompts/v0.0.2/frontend-helper.mdc

---

Now I'll look for the existing multi-agent structure to understand how these files are organized:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory /Users/narender/Desktop/personal/agenticPrompts/v0.0.2 • **13** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `frontend-helper.mdc` |
| 📄 `quick-answer.mdc` |
| 📄 `context-explorer.mdc` |
| 📄 `git-committer.mdc` |
| 📄 `wizard.mdc` |
| 📄 `architect-planner.mdc` |
| 📄 `feature-planner.mdc` |
| 📄 `roaster.mdc` |
| 📄 `reviewer.mdc` |
| 📄 `tester.mdc` |
| 📄 `implementer.mdc` |
| 📄 `refactoring-guru.mdc` |
| 📄 `fix-planner.mdc` |

</details>

---

Now I'll check if there is a frontend folder where these new agents should be placed:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory /Users/narender/Desktop/personal/agenticPrompts • **6** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `frontend` |
| 📁 `v0.0.2` |
| 📁 `.git` |
| 📁 `default` |
| 📁 `v0.0.1` |
| 📁 `.cursor` |

</details>

---

Perfect! There is a frontend folder. Let's check its contents:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory /Users/narender/Desktop/personal/agenticPrompts/frontend • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

Great! Now I'll create the two new agent files in the frontend folder:

1. First, the CSS Expert agent:

I've created two specialized frontend agents for your multi-agent system:

1. **CSS Expert Agent** (`/frontend/css-expert.mdc`)
   - Focuses on creating beautiful, maintainable, and performant CSS implementations
   - Expertise in modern CSS techniques, responsive design, animations, and cross-browser compatibility
   - Handles CSS architecture, layouts, animations, performance optimization, and framework integration

2. **UI Expert Agent** (`/frontend/ui-expert.mdc`)
   - Specializes in creating intuitive, accessible, and engaging user interfaces
   - Focuses on component design, interaction patterns, and information architecture
   - Handles component implementation, interaction design, forms, accessibility, and responsive UI

Both agents are designed to coordinate seamlessly with your existing multi-agent system:

_**Assistant**_

It looks like you're trying to run `cursor++` but getting an error related to a brew command. This error suggests there might be an issue with the command syntax or installation.

The correct way to install Cursor++ should be through their official channels. The error message shows it's trying to interpret this as a Homebrew command, which is incorrect.

To fix this:

1. First, make sure you have Cursor installed properly
2. To update or use Cursor++, you should:
   - Either update through the application itself
   - Or visit the official Cursor website/repository for installation instructions

The error `Error: Unknown command: brew nsnarender5511/tap/cpp` indicates that the system is incorrectly trying to interpret this as a Homebrew command, which is not the correct way to run or install Cursor++.

If you're trying to update Cursor, I recommend:
1. Opening the Cursor application
2. Checking for updates through the application menu
3. Or visiting the official Cursor website for the correct installation/update method

The command `cursor++` is not a valid terminal command - it seems to be getting confused with a Homebrew formula path.

Based on the search results, I can help you fix the Cursor installation issue. There are two ways to fix this:

1. Quick Fix:
```bash
rm /opt/homebrew/bin/cursor
ln -s /Applications/Cursor.app/Contents/Resources/app/cursor /opt/homebrew/bin/cursor
```

2. Clean Installation:
```bash
# First uninstall current version
brew uninstall --cask cursor

# Then reinstall
brew install --cask cursor
```

The issue appears to be related to a binary path problem in the recent Homebrew cask. The fix has been merged into Homebrew, so a fresh installation should work correctly.

If you still encounter issues after trying these solutions, you can also try:

1. Opening Cursor directly from the Applications folder
2. Using the absolute path: `/usr/local/bin/cursor` or `/opt/homebrew/bin/cursor` with your commands

Would you like me to help you try any of these solutions?

It looks like there's a confusion with the formula names and installation commands. The error suggests that `cursor++` is not available as a formula in the tap. Instead, the tap seems to have `cpp` and `crules` formulas.

To fix this, you should:

1. First, verify what formulas are available in the tap:
```bash
brew tap-info nsnarender5511/tap --json
```

2. Then install the correct formula. Based on the error message, you probably want:
```bash
brew install nsnarender5511/tap/cpp
```

The error `Expected to find class Cursorxx, but found no classes` indicates that the formula file for `cursor++` is either missing or malformed. The tap doesn't have a properly defined formula for `cursor++`.

If you're trying to install Cursor (the AI editor), that's a different package and should be installed with:
```bash
brew install --cask cursor
```

Which package are you trying to install specifically? That would help me give you the correct command.

I see from the tap-info that `cursor++` is actually listed as one of the formula names in your tap, but there seems to be an issue with the formula file itself.

Let's try to fix this:

1. First, since `cpp` is already installed (as shown by the message "cpp 0.0.3 is already installed and up-to-date"), let's try reinstalling cursor++ specifically:

```bash
brew reinstall nsnarender5511/tap/cursor++
```

If that doesn't work, you can try:

```bash
brew update && brew upgrade nsnarender5511/tap/cursor++
```

The error you're seeing ("Expected to find class Cursorxx") suggests there might be an issue with the formula definition in the tap. Since this is your tap (nsnarender5511), you might want to check the formula file at:
`/opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/nsnarender5511/homebrew-tap/cursor++.rb`

Would you like me to help you check the formula file to see what might be wrong with it?

The error shows that your brew formula file exists but is malformed - it's missing the required Ruby class definition. To fix this:

1. Check and edit the formula file:
```bash
nano /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/nsnarender5511/homebrew-tap/cursor++.rb
```

2. The file should contain a proper Ruby class definition, something like:
```ruby
class Cursorxx < Formula
  desc "Description of cursor++"
  homepage "https://your-homepage"
  url "https://download-url/cursor++-0.1.0.tar.gz"
  sha256 "sha256-hash-of-the-archive"
  
  # Add dependencies, installation instructions, etc.
  
  def install
    # Installation commands
  end
  
  test do
    # Test commands
  end
end
```

The key issue is that the formula file exists but doesn't contain the required Ruby class definition - it needs a class called `Cursorxx` (the `++` gets converted to `xx` in the class name).

Alternatively, if you're just trying to use cursor++, you might consider reinstalling the tap:
```bash
brew untap nsnarender5511/tap
brew tap nsnarender5511/tap
```

Error: Refusing to untap nsnarender5511/tap because it contains the following installed formulae or casks:

_**Assistant**_

You need to uninstall the formula from the tap before you can untap it:

```bash
# First uninstall cpp from the tap
brew uninstall nsnarender5511/tap/cpp

# Then you can untap
brew untap nsnarender5511/tap

# Now you can retap if needed
brew tap nsnarender5511/tap
```

If you want to keep using cpp but fix the cursor++ formula, you should edit the formula file directly:

```bash
# Edit the cursor++ formula
nano /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/nsnarender5511/homebrew-tap/cursor++.rb
```

Make sure the file contains a proper class definition as mentioned earlier:

```ruby
class Cursorxx < Formula
  # Formula content here
end
```
