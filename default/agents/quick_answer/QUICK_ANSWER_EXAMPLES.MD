"To convert a PNG image to JPEG format using ImageMagick, you would typically use the convert command-line tool that comes with ImageMagick. This tool is quite powerful and allows you to specify various parameters for the conversion. Here's how you would do a basic conversion from PNG to JPEG:"
```
convert image.png image.jpg
```
"If you want to specify the quality of the resulting JPEG, you can add a -quality parameter followed by a number from 1 to 100, where higher numbers represent better quality. For example:"
```
convert image.png -quality 85 image.jpg
```
