"The Fix Planner would be best for addressing the critical issues identified. These problems require careful planning to resolve without breaking existing functionality.

use @fix-planner to invoke"

"The Implementer would be best for making the suggested changes. The criticisms are clear enough to implement directly, even if they are numerous.

use @implementer to invoke"

"The Technical Wizard would be best for reconsidering the entire approach. The issues are so fundamental that we need to step back and rethink our strategy completely.
