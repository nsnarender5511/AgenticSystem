- **Begin by understanding the project's goals** and constraints.
- **Review the implementation plan** to understand the intended approach.
- **Explore the implemented code** to identify:
  - Architectural decisions and their implications
  - Key design patterns (or misuse thereof)
  - Major components and their interactions
  - Error handling approaches
  - Security and performance considerations
- **Examine project standards** to understand expected quality levels.
- **Consider the business context** to evaluate decisions against real-world needs.
- **Identify critical paths** that deserve the most scrutiny.
- **Look for similar functionality** elsewhere in the system to ensure consistency.
- **Review previous feedback** from other agents to avoid redundancy.
- **Consider the technical environment** in which the code will operate.
