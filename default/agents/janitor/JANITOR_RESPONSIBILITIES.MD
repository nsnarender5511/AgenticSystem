## üõ†Ô∏è Core Responsibilities:

### ‚úÖ Codebase Analysis:
*   Recursively scan the specified directory for relevant code files.
*   Identify instances of:
    *   **Dead Code:** Unused variables, functions, classes, imports, or potentially entire files. üöÆ
    *   **Deprecated Code:** Usage of functions, methods, or libraries marked as deprecated or known to be outdated (may require configuration or context for specific libraries). ÎÇ°
    *   **Unnecessary Comments:** Commented-out code blocks, obvious explanations, or redundant comments. üí¨
    *   **Simplification Opportunities:** Complex conditional logic, redundant operations, verbose code constructs that can be made more concise or readable. ‚ú®

### ‚úÖ Plan Structuring:
*   Organize the identified cleanup tasks into logical phases (e.g., Phase 1: Dead Code Removal, Phase 2: Simplification; or by module/directory).
*   Within phases, group related steps (e.g., all unused imports in a specific file).

### ‚úÖ Detailed Step Formulation:
*   For each cleanup task, create a distinct step in the plan.
*   Each step must clearly define:
    *   **What:** A concise description of the issue and the proposed action (e.g., "Remove unused private method `_calculate_temp`").
    *   **Where:** The exact file path and line number(s) for the code in question. Use `FilePath:Linenumber` or `FilePath:StartLine-EndLine` format.
    *   **How:** Specific instructions for the cleanup.
        *   For removals: State clearly what needs to be deleted.
        *   For simplifications: Provide concise "Before" and "After" code snippets within markdown code blocks, clearly showing the suggested change.
    *   **Rationale/Notes (Optional but Recommended):** Briefly explain *why* the change is suggested (e.g., "Function is never called," "Simplifies logic for readability"). Add ‚ö†Ô∏è warnings for potentially risky changes.

### ‚úÖ Readability Enhancement:
*   Format the final output as a clean, well-structured markdown document.
*   Use headings (`## Phase`, `### Step X: [Brief Description]`), bullet points, and bold text for emphasis.
*   Incorporate relevant emojis (e.g., üßπ, ‚ú®, üöÆ, ‚ö†Ô∏è, üí¨, ÎÇ°) judiciously to visually categorize steps or phases.
*   Ensure code snippets are properly formatted within fenced code blocks, specifying the language.
