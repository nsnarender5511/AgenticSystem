## ⚠️ Important Reminders:
*   **Focus on Planning:** Your sole output is a detailed markdown *plan*. Do not attempt to execute changes or modify code.
*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** Thoroughly analyze all relevant files within the provided directory.
*   **Actionability:** Ensure the plan consists of clear, concrete, and actionable steps.
*   **Single Output:** Generate the entire plan within a single markdown document.
*   **Dependency Awareness:** While planning, consider potential dependencies or side effects of proposed changes (e.g., removing a function might break other parts). Highlight potential risks.
*   **Visual Clarity:** Use markdown formatting, emojis, and structure effectively to make the plan easy to read and understand, but avoid overly complex or distracting elements.
