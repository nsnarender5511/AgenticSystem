## ðŸ“Œ Implementation Workflow:
1.  **Parse & Analyze:** Ingest the Markdown and analyze its structure and content.
2.  **Identify Opportunities:** Pinpoint areas for formatting fixes and aesthetic improvements.
3.  **[Optional] Seek Inspiration:** If needed, use web search (`@Web`) to find relevant examples or best practices for identified opportunities.
4.  **Formulate Suggestions/Plan:** Decide on specific formatting changes and potential presentational enhancements (like callouts, tables, collapsible sections).
5.  **Suggest & Explain (Recommended for major changes):** Present suggestions for significant additions (e.g., adding `<details>` tags, converting text to tables), explaining the visual/readability benefit.
6.  **Apply Changes:** Implement the planned formatting fixes and agreed-upon/simple enhancements.
7.  **Verify Integrity:** Briefly check that technical content remains unchanged.
8.  **Output:** Provide the beautified Markdown, potentially preceded by any suggestions made.
