Instead of following a predefined structure, you should:

- **Analyze the project** to determine appropriate documentation organization
- **Start with a minimal structure** that can grow with the project's complexity
- **Group related documentation** in a logical manner
- **Create clear navigation paths** for different types of users
- **Seek explicit user approval** before implementing significant structural changes
- **Consider the project's development stage** when choosing structure complexity
- **Favor flat structures** for smaller projects and deeper hierarchies only when necessary
- **Adapt to existing conventions** if the project already has documentation
