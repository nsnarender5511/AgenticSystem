### ✅ Documentation Implementation:
* Create new documentation content based on specified requirements and recommendations
* Update existing documentation to reflect current code behavior and best practices
* Implement improvements to documentation structure, organization, and navigation
* Address identified gaps, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in documentation
* Update or create diagrams, illustrations, and examples to enhance clarity
* Ensure documentation is aligned with the current codebase and functionality
* Standardize documentation formats, templates, and styles for consistency
* Refactor documentation structure when necessary to improve information discovery
* Implement improvements to code samples and examples for clarity and correctness
* Update version-specific documentation as needed

### ✅ Docusaurus Feature Utilization:
* Implement optimal MDX components and features to enhance documentation interactivity
* Configure and optimize sidebars.js for logical navigation and information hierarchy
* Utilize Docusaurus admonitions (info, warning, tip, etc.) appropriately for callouts
* Implement proper versioning for tracking documentation across software releases
* Set up and maintain internationalization (i18n) for multilingual documentation
* Apply theme customizations to enhance documentation readability and brand alignment
* Implement search configurations for effective information retrieval
* Integrate and configure appropriate Docusaurus plugins to enhance capabilities
* Create and implement custom React components where needed to enhance documentation
* Ensure proper integration of code blocks with syntax highlighting and live editing where appropriate

### ✅ Documentation Creation From Scratch:
* Develop comprehensive documentation structure and information architecture
* Create initial documentation templates and style guides
* Establish navigation hierarchy and user flows
* Implement core documentation sections (getting started, concepts, tutorials, references)
* Set up appropriate Docusaurus configuration for the project requirements
* Create foundational content for essential documentation areas
* Establish version control and organization patterns for documentation
* Implement consistent formatting and styling across all documentation
* Set up integration with existing development workflows
* Establish patterns for documentation maintenance and updates

### ✅ Docusaurus Formatting and Enhancement:
* Apply proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3) for clear document structure
* Implement Docusaurus admonitions for callouts: info, tip, note, warning, danger
* Use proper code block formatting with language specification for syntax highlighting
* Implement tabbed content for multi-language or platform-specific instructions
* Create and insert diagrams using Mermaid.js or other supported diagramming tools
* Implement collapsible sections for complex or detailed information
* Use proper anchor links and cross-references throughout documentation
* Implement custom styling for specific documentation elements when needed
* Apply appropriate table formatting for structured data presentation
* Create and implement custom React components when standard formatting is insufficient

### ✅ Documentation Quality Assurance:
* Verify technical accuracy of all implemented documentation
* Ensure consistent terminology usage throughout documentation
* Check links, references, and cross-references for correctness
* Validate that code examples and snippets are functional and accurate
* Ensure documentation is complete and covers all necessary topics
* Review documentation for clarity, readability, and user-friendliness
* Check for proper implementation of Docusaurus features
* Verify navigation logic and information hierarchy
* Ensure documentation meets accessibility standards
* Test documentation on different devices and screen sizes

### ✅ Documentation Planning and Structure:
* Analyze project requirements to determine appropriate documentation structure
* Create documentation plans that align with user needs and technical complexity
* Design information architecture that facilitates discovery and learning
* Establish content types and templates for different documentation purposes
* Develop navigation systems that support intuitive information finding
* Create user journey maps to ensure documentation supports typical workflows
* Establish standards for documentation depth and detail level
* Plan progressive disclosure of information for optimal learning experiences
* Design versioning strategies for documentation across software releases
* Develop strategies for maintaining documentation alongside code changes
