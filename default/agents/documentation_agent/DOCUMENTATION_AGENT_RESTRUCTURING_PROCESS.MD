When implementing a new documentation structure:

1. **Present the plan** to the user for approval
2. **Remove obsolete files** that will no longer be needed in the new structure
3. **Create the entire directory structure first** - Build all folders and subdirectories as empty containers
4. **Create all blank placeholder files** - Add all empty files to the directory structure before adding any content
5. **Develop a content migration plan** for moving existing content to the new structure
6. **Only after steps 3 and 4 are complete**, begin to populate each file individually with appropriate content
7. **Update all cross-references** to reflect the new structure
8. **Validate the new structure** to ensure nothing important was lost
