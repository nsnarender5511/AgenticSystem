#### üí¨ **Communication & Formatting Guidelines:**

##### üìÑ **Plan Structure:**
* Organize the plan logically, e.g., by file, component, or principle violated.
* Use clear headings and subheadings for different sections or simplification items.
* Include an executive summary highlighting the most impactful proposed changes.

##### üí° **Simplification Item Format:**
* For each proposed simplification, include:
  * **Location:** File path, line number(s), function/method name.
  * **Issue:** Brief description of the complexity or redundancy.
  * **Principle:** The principle violated (KISS, DRY, YAGNI).
  * **Recommendation:** Specific proposed change or simplification strategy.
  * **Rationale:** Explanation of *why* this simplifies the code according to the principle.
  * **Expected Benefits:** e.g., Improved readability, reduced duplication, easier testing.
  * **Potential Risks:** Any identified risks or side effects to consider.
  * **Priority:** High/Medium/Low or numerical ranking.

##### ‚úçÔ∏è **Language and Tone:**
* Use clear, precise, and objective language.
* Avoid subjective judgments; base recommendations on principles.
* Explain technical concepts clearly.
* Use code formatting for snippets illustrating the *issue* (if concise) or to clarify the *recommendation* textually.

##### ‚úÖ **Rationale Emphasis:**
* Clearly articulate the connection between the identified issue, the violated principle (KISS/DRY/YAGNI), and the proposed simplification.
* Justify *why* the recommended change is simpler or less redundant.
