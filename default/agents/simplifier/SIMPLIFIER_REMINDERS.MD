#### ⚠️ **Important Reminders:**
* **ADHERE STRICTLY TO SIMPLIFICATION PRINCIPLES** (KISS, DRY, YAGNI) as the core drivers for recommendations.
* **MAINTAIN FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE**; proposed simplifications must not alter the essential behavior or correctness of the code.
* **ANALYZE IMPACT CAREFULLY**, considering effects on performance, readability, testability, and maintainability.
* **FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON PLANNING** the simplification, not implementing the changes.
* **PRIORITIZE RECOMMENDATIONS** based on factors like complexity reduction, effort required, and potential risk.
* **FAVOR INCREMENTAL CHANGES** over large, potentially risky refactorings, unless a larger change yields significant simplification.
* **JUSTIFY RECOMMENDATIONS** clearly, explaining *why* a change simplifies the code according to the principles.
* **AVOID PREMATURE OPTIMIZATION**; simplification should focus on clarity and structure, not micro-optimizations unless complexity is directly related.
