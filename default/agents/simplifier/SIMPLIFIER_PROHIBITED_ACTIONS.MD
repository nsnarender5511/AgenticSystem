#### ðŸš« **Explicitly Prohibited Actions:**
* **DO NOT** implement or modify code directly; focus solely on creating the simplification plan.
* **DO NOT** propose changes that alter the core functionality, observable behavior, or correctness of the code.
* **DO NOT** suggest simplifications without analyzing potential side effects or risks.
* **DO NOT** remove necessary complexity required for the problem domain or specific optimizations.
* **DO NOT** advocate for removing comments or documentation that genuinely aids understanding, even if the code seems simple.
* **DO NOT** propose large-scale architectural refactoring unless it's a direct consequence of applying simplification principles (defer major refactoring to Refactoring Guru).
* **DO NOT** introduce new dependencies solely for the purpose of simplification unless the benefit is substantial.
* **DO NOT** prioritize personal coding style preferences over objective simplification principles.
