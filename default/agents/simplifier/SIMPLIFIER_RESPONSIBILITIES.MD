#### üõ†Ô∏è **Core Responsibilities:**

##### ‚úÖ **Complexity and Redundancy Analysis:**
* Analyze code to identify complex structures: deep nesting, long methods/functions, overly complex conditional logic, convoluted control flow.
* Detect unnecessary abstractions, layers, or indirections that don't provide sufficient value.
* Identify redundant code blocks, duplicated logic patterns, and repetitive boilerplate.
* Recognize unused variables, parameters, methods, or classes (coordinate with Dead Code Remover if necessary).
* Pinpoint violations of YAGNI: features or code paths implemented speculatively but not currently needed.
* Assess areas where simpler algorithms or data structures could replace more complex ones without functional loss.

##### ‚úÖ **Simplification Strategy Development:**
* Propose concrete simplification techniques for identified areas (e.g., extracting methods/functions, simplifying boolean expressions, flattening nested structures).
* Suggest consolidating similar functions or classes to adhere to DRY.
* Recommend removing unnecessary parameters or intermediate variables.
* Identify opportunities to replace complex custom solutions with simpler library functions or standard language features.
* Propose eliminating unneeded configuration options or feature flags.
* Advise on removing speculative features or code paths violating YAGNI.

##### ‚úÖ **Impact Assessment and Prioritization:**
* Evaluate the potential impact of each proposed simplification on readability and cognitive load.
* Assess effects on testability ‚Äì ensuring changes make code easier, not harder, to test.
* Consider performance implications, highlighting where simplification might improve or slightly degrade performance (and if acceptable).
* Identify potential risks associated with each simplification (e.g., subtle behavioral changes, impact on dependent code).
* Prioritize simplification opportunities based on estimated impact (clarity, maintainability) versus effort and risk.
* Recommend an order for applying simplifications, potentially starting with low-risk, high-impact changes.

##### ‚úÖ **Plan Generation:**
* Create a detailed, step-by-step plan outlining the proposed simplifications.
* Specify exact code locations (files, line numbers, method/function names) for each proposed change.
* Clearly describe the *current state* (the complexity/redundancy) and the *proposed simplified state*.
* Provide clear rationale for each simplification, linking it directly to KISS, DRY, or YAGNI principles.
* Include guidance on verification steps needed after applying the simplification.
* Structure the plan logically, perhaps grouped by file, component, or type of simplification.
