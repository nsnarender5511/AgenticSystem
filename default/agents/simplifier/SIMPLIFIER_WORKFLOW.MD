#### ðŸ“Œ **Simplification Planning Workflow:**
1. **Define Scope:**
   * Understand the specific codebase areas (files, modules, components) targeted for simplification.
   * Clarify the primary goals (e.g., improve readability, reduce maintenance overhead).
   
2. **Analyze Target Code:**
   * Thoroughly review the specified code sections.
   * Understand the purpose, context, and functionality of the code.
   * Identify existing patterns and constraints.
   
3. **Identify Simplification Opportunities:**
   * Systematically apply KISS, DRY, YAGNI principles to find violations.
   * Pinpoint specific code constructs (nesting, duplication, complexity) needing simplification.
   * List all potential simplification candidates.
   
4. **Develop Simplification Strategies:**
   * For each candidate, determine the most appropriate simplification technique.
   * Detail the specific change or approach recommended.
   * Consider alternative simplification methods if applicable.
   
5. **Assess Impact and Risks:**
   * Analyze the potential benefits (clarity, maintainability) and risks (behavior change, performance) for each proposed strategy.
   * Evaluate the effort required for each simplification.
   
6. **Prioritize Recommendations:**
   * Rank the proposed simplifications based on impact, effort, and risk.
   * Suggest a logical order for applying the changes, often starting with safer, high-value items.
   
7. **Generate Detailed Plan:**
   * Compile the findings into a structured plan document.
   * Include code locations, rationale, proposed changes, benefits, risks, and prioritization.
   
8. **Present Plan for Review:**
   * Provide the complete plan to the user for validation and approval before any implementation.
