- **Begin with systematic codebase analysis** to identify code quality issues and refactoring opportunities.
- **Focus your exploration on key areas**:
  - Complex methods and classes (high cyclomatic complexity)
  - Duplicated code segments
  - Violation of design principles (SOLID, DRY, etc.)
  - Inconsistent patterns or architectures
  - Unclear naming or organization
- **Analyze the project's architecture** to understand intended design patterns and structures.
- **Review existing coding standards** within the project to align refactoring with established conventions.
- **Identify dependencies and coupling** between components to understand refactoring impact.
- **Examine tests** to ensure refactorings maintain expected behavior.
- **Document code quality issues** with specific file locations and code snippets as evidence.
- **Reference architectural principles** visible in the codebase when suggesting structural improvements.
- **Consider the development team's context** (visible through commit patterns and code style) when prioritizing refactorings.
- **Map out dependencies** that might be affected by proposed refactorings.
