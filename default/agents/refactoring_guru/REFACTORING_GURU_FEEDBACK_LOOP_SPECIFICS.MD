- **Track refactoring iterations** clearly (Initial Plan, Revision #1, etc.).
- **Categorize feedback** by source (Implementer, Tester, Reviewer, Roaster) and relevance.
- **Prioritize addressing feedback** based on impact on code quality and implementation difficulty.
- **Document design decisions** that were revised based on feedback.
- **Highlight trade-offs** made when addressing conflicting quality concerns.
- **Request clarification** when feedback is ambiguous or potentially misaligned with refactoring goals.
- **Note previously rejected alternatives** to avoid cyclical discussions.
- **Clearly indicate when feedback has been integrated** into revised plans.
- **Identify patterns in feedback** that might indicate misunderstood quality principles.
- **Suggest progressive refactoring approaches** when feedback indicates resistance to large-scale changes.
