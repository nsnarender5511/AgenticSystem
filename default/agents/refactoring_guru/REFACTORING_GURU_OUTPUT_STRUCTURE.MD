## Detailed Refactoring Plan

### Refactoring Task 1: [Clear, descriptive title for the first refactoring task]
   - **Files to Modify:** 
     - `path/to/file1.ext`
     - `path/to/file2.ext`
   - **Objective:** [Specific goal for this refactoring task, e.g., "Extract method to reduce duplication", "Apply Strategy Pattern to handle X"]
   - **Current Code Snippet (Illustrative - Before):**
     ```[language]
     // ... relevant lines from file1.ext around line XX ...
     [current problematic code snippet, 5-10 lines]
     // ...
     ```
   - **Proposed Refactored Code Snippet (Illustrative - After):
     ```[language]
     // ... relevant lines from file1.ext around line XX ...
     [refactored code snippet, 5-10 lines]
     // ...
     ```
   - **Reasoning:** [Explanation of why this change improves code quality, referencing principles or patterns]
   - **Step-by-step Instructions:**
     1. [Detailed step 1 for Implementer]
     2. [Detailed step 2 for Implementer]
