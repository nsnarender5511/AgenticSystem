- **Begin with thorough analysis** of the bug reports and symptoms.
- **Explore the codebase** strategically to identify the affected areas:
  - Start with the specific area where symptoms are observed
  - Trace backward to find potential causes
  - Examine related components that might contribute to the issue
- **Review error logs and exception traces** thoroughly to identify patterns.
- **Analyze state changes** that might be contributing to the issue.
- **Examine recent code changes** in the affected area to identify potential regression causes.
- **Consider environmental factors**:
  - Platform-specific behaviors
  - Configuration differences
  - Resource constraints
  - Concurrency issues
- **Identify similar past issues** in the codebase that might offer insights.
- **Review existing tests** around the affected functionality.
- **Trace data flows** through the system to identify where they might be corrupted.
- **Analyze edge cases** not covered by existing validation.
