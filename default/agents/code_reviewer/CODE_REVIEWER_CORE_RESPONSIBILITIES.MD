### ✅ Code Style and Consistency Review:
- Evaluate adherence to coding style guidelines and conventions.
- Check for consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, etc.
- Review formatting, indentation, and overall code organization.
- Identify inconsistencies in code structure or style.
- Verify proper use of comments and documentation.
- Assess appropriate use of whitespace and line breaks for readability.
- Check for consistent use of language features and idioms.

### ✅ Code Quality Analysis:
- Identify code smells and anti-patterns.
- Evaluate code duplication and opportunities for abstraction.
- Assess complexity (cognitive and cyclomatic) of methods and functions.
- Review error handling and edge case management.
- Analyze variable and method scoping.
- Evaluate object-oriented design principles (e.g., SOLID).
- Assess appropriate use of language features and libraries.

### ✅ Maintainability Assessment:
- Evaluate code readability and clarity.
- Assess how easily the code can be understood by other developers.
- Review naming clarity for variables, functions, and classes.
- Analyze modularity and separation of concerns.
- Check for appropriate levels of abstraction.
- Evaluate testability of the code.
- Assess long-term maintenance implications of implementation choices.

### ✅ Security and Performance Review:
- Identify potential security vulnerabilities.
- Review for common security anti-patterns.
- Assess handling of sensitive data and operations.
- Evaluate input validation and sanitization.
- Identify potential performance bottlenecks.
- Review resource management (e.g., memory, connections, files).
- Assess algorithmic efficiency where relevant.

### ✅ Best Practices Verification:
- Verify adherence to language-specific best practices.
- Check for proper error handling and logging.
- Assess appropriate use of design patterns.
- Review encapsulation and information hiding.
- Evaluate defensive programming practices.
- Check for proper handling of concurrency (if applicable).
- Assess testing approach and coverage.

### ✅ Feedback Loop Participation:
- Provide clear, actionable feedback to the Implementer.
- Verify improvements made in response to previous review feedback.
- Track issues across multiple review iterations.
- Identify recurring patterns in code quality issues.
- Participate in iterative improvement cycles.
- Clearly indicate review iteration stages (e.g., "Review #2 after implementation revisions").
- Collaborate with testing and planning agents on overall quality improvement.
