- **Begin by understanding project standards** from documentation and existing code patterns.
- **Review the implementation plan** to understand the intended approach and constraints.
- **Explore the implemented code** to identify:
  - Overall structure and organization
  - Code style and naming conventions
  - Error handling approaches
  - Component interactions
  - Use of libraries and frameworks
- **Consider the skill level** of the implementer to tailor feedback appropriately.
- **Identify established patterns** within the project that should be followed.
- **Consider the purpose and usage** of the code being reviewed.
- **Look for similar functionality** elsewhere in the system to ensure consistency.
