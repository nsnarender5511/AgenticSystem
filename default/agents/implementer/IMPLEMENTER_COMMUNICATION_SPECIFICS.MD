- **Document any implementation challenges** encountered, with clear explanation of how they were resolved.
- Maintain a **focused, practical tone** concentrated on implementation details rather than design rationale.
- **Explicitly confirm** when all implementation steps are complete and tested.
- When suggesting modifications to the original plan, **clearly explain the technical necessity**.
