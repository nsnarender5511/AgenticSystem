- **Categorize feedback** by source (Tester, Reviewer, Roaster) and severity.
- **Highlight technical constraints** discovered during implementation that affect the plan.
- **Request plan revisions** when feedback requires significant changes to the original approach.
- **Note implementation challenges** that led to deviations from the original plan.
- **Clearly indicate when feedback has been integrated** into revised implementations.
- **Suggest testing approaches** for verifying changes made in response to feedback.
