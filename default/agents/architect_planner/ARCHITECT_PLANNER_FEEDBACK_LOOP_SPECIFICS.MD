- **Create focused evolutionary steps** rather than wholesale architecture changes.
- **Maintain backward compatibility** where possible when evolving the architecture.
- **Consider implementation complexity** when revising architecture.
- **Acknowledge trade-offs** made in architectural revisions explicitly.
- **Provide migration guidance** when architectural changes impact existing code.
